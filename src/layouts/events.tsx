She is working on monitoring, observability and performance. Before AWS, she worked on different products at Google, including the Go Programming Language. In her blog (rakyll.org), she provides useful everyday practical tips about Go programming language ecosystem. The article summarizes how the Go defer function works and walks through the changes in the performance of this function throughout the years. It recommends listening to a relevant episode of the GoTime podcast (linked below) as an additional resource.'}

            title={'Reading club: Web Security & Go (Error Handling and Logging)'}
            content={'The article for this month\'s reading club is 1.8 Error Handling and Logging, which is part of a longer report written by the OWASP Foundation called Web Application Secure Coding Practices, The Go Language Guide. This topic was inspired by learning that the Go language is one of the popular languages used by cyber criminals in 2020. In this event, we\'re going to cover error handling and logging which are essential parts of application and infrastructure protection. When Error Handling is mentioned, it is referring to the capture of any errors in our application logic that may cause the system to crash, unless handled correctly. On the other hand, logging highlights all the operations and requests that occurred on our system. Since attackers often attempt to remove all traces of their action by deleting logs, it\'s critical that logs are centralized.'}
