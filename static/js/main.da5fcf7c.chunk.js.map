When Error Handling is mentioned, it is referring to the capture of any errors in our application logic that may cause the system to crash, unless handled correctly.

Tournoij has been working in Go for the last 5 years. This post from earlier in the year had a number of active discussions on Hacker News, Lobsters, and various programming subreddits.The article offers the perspective that Go, despite having a straightforward syntax, is not an easy language to learn or to use. It’s likely you’ll go wrong (ha ha) in subtle ways and barriers to entry are hard to make out behind the promise that it is “easy”. Tournoij argues that languages are about ways of thinking, more than they are about grammar and primitives. Beyond A Tour of Go, where do we go to learn Go thinking?'}\n            signUpLink={'https://www.meetup.com/women-who-go-toronto/events/277071882'}\n          />\n        </div>\n        <div className={'flex flex-column'}>\n          <EventInfo\n            day={24}\n            month={'Mar'}\n            year={2021}\n            title={'Reading Club: Failure is your domain'}\n            content={'The article for this reading club is \"Failure is your domain\".

This article went viral when it was first published in 2018. It was the most clicked link in the Go weekly newsletter that year. The post was shared on reddit at the time and resulted in a lot of feedback and suggestions that was then incorporated by the author into his talk at GopherCon 2019.
